So I actually went to a number of different schools as a child. I'm going to
tell you about the second school I went to.

So the first day, and I remember at my second school, was quite itersting. I
moved there when I was siz. I think I must have been about six or seven. My
mother wasn't she hadn't been very happy with me, with the previous school, I
should say, so she insisted that we change.

I remember on the first day turning up (to appear), or more accurately, my
parents dropped me off, and they were quite anxious and apprehensive
(worried), as it was my first day at school.

And me too, I was a bit nervous. I had no idea what was in store for me
(waiting for me).

And I just remenber walking in and thinking it was so big. I was overwhelmed
(a feeling that everything is too much) by the size of everything; the
playground, the classrooms, the assembly hall just seemed gigantic (very big)
and everything was a bit of blur (not clearly visible)

It just happened so quickly. But I can still recall quite vividly (remenber
clearly) going into the first classroom with my first teacher, who appeared to
be a very calm and thoughtful lady, very much in control.

She seemed to be kind of tough and fair, I would say. And she introduced me to
the whole class, which was great because it really made me feel at home.

And although I was a bit fidgety (moving your body nervously), this helped me
relax and settle in (feel comfortable in a new place) quite well.

I also remember the first playtime, the break, right, when we went out into
the playground. There was this great big climbing frame and an obstacle
course, and I just found it so easy to make friends. And we played together,
and I felt great.

I think, talking about my feelings of the whole day, I was really comfortable,
and I felt quite relaxed at the end of the day. And I thought, yeah, this is a
school. It's going to be easy for me to fit in (feel a sense of belonging in a
new place). And as it turns out (the end result was), it was. I really, really
liked that school. I enjoyed it a lot.
