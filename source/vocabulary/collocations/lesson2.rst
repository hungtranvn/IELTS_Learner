Finding collocations
********************

After *giving Mark a lift* to the airport, Julie *made her way* home. What an
exciting *life he led*! At times Julie felt *desperately jealous* of him. She
*spent her time* doing little more than *taking care of* him and the children. Now
her sister was *getting divorced* and would doubtless be *making demands on* her
too. Julie had promised to *give her sister a call* as soom as she got home but
she decided to *run herself a bath* first. She had a *sharp pain* in her side and
hoped that a hot bath might *ease the pain*.

My friend Abigail is *desperately worried* about her son at the moment. He wants
to *enrol on a course* of some sort but just can't *make a decision* about what to
study. I *gave Abigail a ring* and we had a *long chat* a bout it last night. She
said he'd like to study for a degree bit is afraid he won't *meet the
requirements* for university entry. Abigail thinks he should *do a course* in
Management because he'd like to *set up his own business* in the future. I
agreed that that would be a *wise choice*.

In the morning I do some work in the garden, then I took a rest for about an
hour before going out to goi shopping in town. It was my sister's birthdat and
I wanted to make a special effort to cook a nice meal for her. I took a look
at a new Thai cookery book in the bookshop and decided to by it. It has some
totally easy recipes and I managed to do a good impression with my very first
Thai meal. I think my sister utterly enjoyed her birthday.
